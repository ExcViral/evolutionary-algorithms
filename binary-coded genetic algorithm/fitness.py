# A fitness function quantifies the optimality of a solution (chromosome) so that that particular solution may be
# ranked against all the other solutions.
# It depicts the closeness of a given ‘solution’ to the desired result.
# NOTE: Watch out for its speed.

# Most functions are stochastic and designed so that a small proportion of less fit solutions are selected. This helps
# keep the diversity of the population large, preventing premature convergence on poor(local) solutions.

# NOTE: Fitness functions will vary from application to application, so for each different application, you will have to
#       define a new fitness function by looking at the goal, and the constraints of the application. This file is a
#       template for implementing the same.
